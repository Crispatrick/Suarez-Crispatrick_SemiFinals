    <h1>Thoughts</h1>
    <h4>by Myra Viola Wilds</h4>

    <p>What kind of thoughts now, do you carry <br>
    In your travels day by day <br>
    Are they bright and lofty visions, <br> 
    Or neglected, gone astray?</p>
    <p>Matters not how great in fancy, <br> 
    Or what deeds of skill youâ€™ve wrought; <br> 
    Man, though high may be his station, <br>
    Is no better than his thoughts. </p>
    <p>Catch your thoughts and hold them tightly, <br> 
    Let each one an honor be; <br>
    Purge them, scourge them, burnish brightly, <br> 
    Then in l4ove set each one free. </p>
