    <h1>We never know how high we are</h1>
    <h4>by Emily Dickinson</h4>
    <hr>

    <p>We never know how high we are <br>
    Till we are called to rise;<br>
    And then, if we are true to plan, <br>
    Our statures touch the skies— <br> </p>
    
    <p>The Heroism we recite <br>
    Would be a daily thing, <br>
    Did not ourselves the Cubits warp <br>
    For fear to be a King—</p>
