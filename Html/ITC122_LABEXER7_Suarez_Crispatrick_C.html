        <h1>The World Is Too Much With Us</h1>
        <h4>By William Wordsworth</h4>
        <hr>
        </div>
        <p>
        The world is too much with us; late and soon, <br>
        Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;— <br>
        Little we see in Nature that is ours; <br>
        We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon! <br>
        This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon; <br>
        The winds that will be howling at all hours, <br>
        And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers; <br>
        For this, for everything, we are out of tune; <br>
        It moves us not. Great God! I’d rather be <br>
        A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn; <br>
        So might I, standing on this pleasant lea, <br>
        Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn; <br>
        Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea; <br>
        Or hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn.

        <h1>The Reading Mother</h1>
        <h4>by Strickland Gillilan</h4>
        <hr>
        </div>
        <p>I had a mother who read to me <br>
        Sagas of pirates who scoured the sea, <br>
        Cutlasses clenched in their yellow teeth, <br>
        “Blackbirds” stowed in the hold beneath </p>

        <h1>Vitae Summa Brevis Spem Nos Vetat Incohare Longam</h1>
        <h4>by Ernest Dowson</h4>
        <hr>
        </div>
        <p>They are not long, the weeping and the laughter, <br>
        Love and desire and hate: <br>
        I think they have no portion in us after <br>
        We pass the gate.</p>
